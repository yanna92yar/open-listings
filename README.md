**Open-listings is a listings' website, particularly, similar to the open-listings we see on news-papers. Let's bring the same idea to the web; This time offering rich input forms, interactive UI, an interactive Map all presented to user with multiple languages and most importantly respecting users privacy.**

> Open-Listings is not production ready ! There are many bugs. I've built it in a mindset like make the whole thing happen quickly ! There is dirty code as well !

## Features
*Open-listings* as a listing web-app is unique in a way and this is why:
  - It runs very fast,
  - It offers multiple sections (based on your target users),
  - It supports tags (like hundreds),
  - Geo-locations (up to thousands),
  - Open possibilities for choices of geolocation to be targeted (country, states),
  - Multiple human languages for the web-app and the posted content.  
  - All are supported in all aspects (UI, back-end, DB, choice of deployment and configuration).

## Maps are simple files !

You can simply target a geolocation, having a delimited map either only the border or with its states or regions. We support geojson files just like the following examples:

<br>
<script src="https://embedhub.com/view/geojson/yanna92yar/open-listings-data/main/geojson_nation_US.geojson"></script>
<br>
<script src="https://embedhub.com/view/geojson/yanna92yar/open-listings-data/main/italy-provinces-Ramer–Douglas–Peucker.json"></script>

## Multi-languages

Open-listings support multiple languages not only for the user interface, but through the whole user experience. Something like Quora, but can be more implicit providing an easier navigation either for publishers or viewers.

A new listing will be analysed by an "machine learning" engine; It is offline and part of Open-listings saving the best performance. The same happens when a viewer searches for listings, we provide a cross-language findings.

## Front-end libraries
Open-listings UI relies heavily on third parties. The following open source solutions have these traits in common: they are bright, lightweight, well maintained and popular. they are simply the best I could find. So big thanks to their creators.      
By this table I'm giving reference to their collaborators and to keep track on their updates.
